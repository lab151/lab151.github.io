Hi! My name is Connor and this is my first dive into blogging! 

A bit about me...

I am a recent Electrical and Electronic Master's Graduate from Perth Australia. I have always been eager to get more involved in sharing knowledge and documenting projects I have worked on, which I believe blogging will help.

I began my journey, from watching a youtube video on how a computer works, the video was excellent and it prompted myself to enrol in engineer courses at University. Since then I have taken every opportunity to learn and develop my engineering skills at or outside of University.

I love working with people and with teams with diverse backgrounds and knowledge. Also I am a avid musician, volunteer and electronics hobbyist.

I am also on github at connor-mcshane.github.io and linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/connor-mcshane.

Here is a photo of me :)
