[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is a highly renowned platform for crowdsourcing data analysis strategies for a variety of datasets. I think its a great idea, especially since there are a vast amount of old data sets where you can test out your own strategies against top performers.

Also, recommendations from people online (such as Quora etc) suggest that using Kaggle and analyzing some of the data sets is one of the best ways to get into data science.

Currently, Kaggle offers learning tutorials called [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) which allow users to get used to using their platform as well as providing some hands-on learning for machine learning concepts. I am currently exploring the [Machine learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning) track and I hope to document my experience with Kaggle Learn in the future!
