Here are a couple of resources I am currently digesting...

## Coursera Machine Learning Course ##

 [Coursera's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) seems to be the goto course for learning the *fundamentals* of Machine Learning. It is an excellent course and it provides fast feedback via quizzes and programming assignments. Also, I can understand that it may be easy to drop off especially with the programming assignments, but I highly advise sticking through and perusing the [tutorial explanation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/all/threads/m0ZdvjSrEeWddiIAC9pDDA) forum that will help you continue through the course without getting bogged down. I also reccomend practicsing and revising matrix operations or basic linear algebra before taking the course.

## Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow ##
[O'reilly and Aurélien Géron](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) have provided a fantastic book which gives a gisty and hands on tutorial into using Scikit-Learn and Tensor flow. I am still reading at the early stages of the book but it seems to be very helpful.

## Dark Pools: The rise of A.I. trading machines and the looming threat to Wall Street ##
[This book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Pools-I-trading-machines-ebook/dp/B008LW1ZVC) was given me to read by a friend, it provides a very fast, face first dive into the construction of today's eletronic trading systems and how they are dominated by highly advanced A.I software. Somewhat of a sad story, it focuses on the construction of the first, scalable and highly successful electronic communication network (ECN), Island by a computer genius called Joshua Levine.
