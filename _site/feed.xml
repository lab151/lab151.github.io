I think its a great idea, especially since there are a vast amount of old data sets where you can test out your own strategies against top performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, recommendations from people online (such as Quora etc) suggest that using Kaggle and analyzing some of the data sets is one of the best ways to get into data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Kaggle offers learning tutorials called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview&quot;&gt;Kaggle Learn&lt;/a&gt; which allow users to get used to using their platform as well as providing some hands-on learning for machine learning concepts. I am currently exploring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning&quot;&gt;Machine learning&lt;/a&gt; track and I hope to document my experience with Kaggle Learn in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Connor and this is my first dive into blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit about me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a recent Electrical and Electronic Master’s Graduate from Perth Australia. I have always been eager to get more involved in sharing knowledge and documenting projects I have worked on, which I believe blogging will help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my journey, from watching a youtube video on how a computer works, the video was excellent and it prompted myself to enrol in engineer courses at University. Since then I have taken every opportunity to learn and develop my engineering skills at or outside of University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love working with people and with teams with diverse backgrounds and knowledge. Also I am a avid musician, volunteer and electronics hobbyist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also on github at connor-mcshane.github.io and linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/connor-mcshane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo of me :)&lt;/p&gt;
